# C Lab Work for CS 341

Because my dumbass lost all my 241 work so we're starting over!

## Some notes on compilation

Writing this here so maybe I don't have to figure it out again.

Two main methods for working:

1. Work directly through SSH on the CS machines and compile there.
2. Get GCC up and running on Windows.

### SSH on CS Machines

Be careful with this because you will likely lose your stupid work if you don't back it up somewhere (see above self deprication).

Can easily SSH into the CS machines using PuTTY:
+ HostName is either <a href = "https://www.cs.unm.edu/computer-facilities/remote-login.html">moons.cs.unm.edu or trucks.cs.unm.edu</a>
